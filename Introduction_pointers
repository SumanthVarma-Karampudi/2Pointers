int main(){
  int a=20;
  a=a+2;             //when I write this statement how the system knows the value of the a, the answer is that control goes to the location/address of a gets the value.
  
  
>>>>>>>ADDRESS OF OPERATOR>>>>>>
How do you get the address of a variable?
using address of(&) operator
cout<<&a<<endl;     //this will print the address of a.



>>>>>>>>>>POINTERS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Now Pointers are the variables that can store the address of the variables.

for eg:----------
int a=10;            //integer variable
int *p;              //pointer is a pointer that stores the address of integer variables
p=&a;
cout<<&a<<endl;      //0x9397494
cout<<p<<endl;       //0x9397494
         
         
         
>>>>>>>>>DEREFERENCE OPERATOR>>>>>>>>> 
operator is ( * )  using this pointers having the address of variables can access the value of that variable.
cout<<*p<<endl;     //output=10   because (pointer)p is storing the address of variable a. Using both a and *p we can access the value.
